    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been just two days of coding classes here at the Flatiron School and I have to admit, I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything like this before. The intense part is I can&rsquo;t even claim to know what it is exactly, but something huge is taking place.</p>

<p>For now, I trust that the above statement is true. Let&rsquo;s go ahead and disregard the fact that my brain completely froze today by about 4pm, causing me to wonder how to spell basic words, or remember if asking git for a list would be &ldquo;li&rdquo; or &ldquo;ls&rdquo; while staring blankly at my screen. It was in that moment that I recalled my first week studying spanish in a full immersion setting where I knew slightly more than my two flatmates and was in charge of translation.</p>

<p>&lt;&mdash; more &mdash;>
&ldquo;Continue &mdash;>&rdquo;
While it&rsquo;s going to be a long, arduous road full of road blocks and potholes to stumbled over and into, I think we&rsquo;ve entered this place in our lives with momentum and the will to get us through, provided we can ask really dumb questions about basic commands when the going gets rough.</p>

<p>Cheers to more mental bashing and bruising!
