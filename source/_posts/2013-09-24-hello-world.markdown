It's been just two days of coding classes here at the Flatiron School and I have to admit, I've never experienced anything like this before. The intense part is I can't even claim to know what it is exactly, but something huge is taking place. 

For now, I trust that the above statement is true. Let's go ahead and disregard the fact that my brain completely froze today by about 4pm, causing me to wonder how to spell basic words, or remember if asking git for a list would be "li" or "ls" while staring blankly at my screen. It was in that moment that I recalled my first week studying spanish in a full immersion setting where I knew slightly more than my two flatmates and was in charge of translation.

While it's going to be a long, arduous road full of road blocks and potholes to stumbled over and into, I think we've entered this place in our lives with momentum and the will to get us through, provided we can ask really dumb questions about basic commands when the going gets rough. 

Cheers to more mental bashing and bruising!
